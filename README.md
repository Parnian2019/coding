# Medibank Coding Challenge

## Name:Parnian Dastangoo

## Overview
Sort through a list of files in a folder structure

## Requirements

- Write a script in Python to search through a directory (and subdirectories) of files.
- Output the list of unique strings with descending order of occurrences next to them
- Only strings with more than 2 occurrences should be reported
- Small dataset, maybe a dozen files. we’re not looking for a new engine or anything
- Answers should have perfect code quality, logic (parameterization, simplicity and efficiency) and originality
- Use the code to showcase your skill and what you value in a software application.
- Words should be case insensitive for counting purposes
- Assume, data is random of different types. I’d recommend to only bother with text content (of both types) 

Note:
Python will be used in this project.


# Project Description: 

Step 1: Importing modules

import os
import re
from collections import Counter
The code begins by importing the necessary modules.

The os module is used to interact with the file system and directories.
The re module is used for regular expressions, which are used to parse the text files.
The Counter class from the collections module is used to count the number of occurrences of each unique word.

Step 2: Defining the get_files(path) function

def get_files(path):
    file_list = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
        for file in files:
            file_list.append(os.path.join(root, file))
    return file_list
The get_files(path) function takes a single argument path which is the path of the directory to be scanned. The function uses the os.walk() method to traverse the directory tree and return a list of all files within the specified directory and its subdirectories. It does this by iterating over each root, directory, and file name within the specified path using a for loop. The file_list variable is used to store the full file path of each file in the directory tree. Once all files have been collected, the file_list is returned by the function.

Step 3: Defining the get_word_counts(file_list) function

def get_word_counts(file_list):
    word_counts = Counter()
    for file in file_list:
        with open(file, "r") as f:
            content = f.read().lower()
            words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', content)
            word_counts.update(words)
    return word_counts
The get_word_counts(file_list) function takes the file_list generated by the get_files() function as an argument. The purpose of this function is to count the number of occurrences of each unique word in all the text files within the specified directory and its subdirectories. The function first creates an empty Counter object to store the counts of each unique word. It then iterates over each file path in the file_list, opening and reading each file using the open() function. The content of the file is converted to lowercase using the .lower() method and then parsed using a regular expression re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', content) which finds all the unique words within the file. Finally, the word_counts Counter object is updated with the counts of each unique word, and the word_counts object is returned.

Step 4: Defining the print_word_counts(word_counts) function

def print_word_counts(word_counts):
    for word, count in sorted(word_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
        if count > 2:
            print(f"{word} {count}")
The print_word_counts(word_counts) function takes the word_counts Counter object generated by the get_word_counts() function as an argument. This function prints the unique words in the files with their counts in descending order. It only prints words that appear more than two times. The function iterates over each unique word and its count using a for loop and the sorted() function. It then checks whether the count is greater than two before printing the word and its count.

Step 5: Running the code


if __name__ == "__main__":
    path ="C:/Program Files"
    file_list = get_files(path)
    word_counts = get_word_counts(file_list)
    print_word_counts(word_counts)

Finally, the if __name__ == "__main__" block defines the entry point of the script. It sets the path variable to the directory to be scanned (in this case, C:/Program Files), calls the get_files(), get_word_counts(), and print_word_counts() functions in order, and prints the top unique words and their counts in descending order.

Summary: The get_files(path) function is called to retrieve a list of all the text files within the specified directory and its subdirectories. The get_word_counts(file_list) function is then called with the file_list argument to count the occurrences of each unique word within the files. Finally, the print_word_counts(word_counts) function is called with the word_counts argument to print the top unique words and their counts.

Overall, the code is designed to be simple and easy to understand. The Counter object provides a quick and efficient way to count the unique words and their occurrences, and regular expressions allow us to extract words from the file content easily. The logic of the functions is straightforward, and the code is parameterized and reusable for other directory paths.
